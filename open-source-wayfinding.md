Finding a welcoming open source project to contribute to can be really overwhelming. If it's your first time contributing to open source, you may understand some of the technology being used but what about all the open source lingo? Let's break down some files you will likely encounter when contributing to an open source project on GitHub.

Before you start searching for and review potential projects for your contribution, you should have some familiarity with what files you may see. Not all of the files mentioned here exist in every project, but they’re common enough that knowing about them makes it much easier for you to navigate projects. Files we'll cover:

- Readme
- Contributing
- Code of conduct
- License or copyright
- Others

### Readme
Typically the very first thing you see for a project is its Readme file. This is the project’s face to the world. The Readme file tells you the name of the project and what it’s intended to do, giving you a quick snapshot to see whether it’s a project that might be useful or interesting to you.
The contents of Readme files vary. Some projects use the file simply to name the project and point you to other resources. Others include those other resources—installation instructions, developer setup, example usage—in the Readme file itself. The contents of this file are entirely up to the project.

Projects that are open to contributions will typically include instructions in the Readme file on how to clone the repository and get the project up and running locally. Be sure to follow these steps before really digging into the project. If you find that your system won't support the software or it's just too difficult or poorly documented to get set up then you can cut your losses early and move on.

Regardless of the contents, the Readme file should be your first stop when you visit any project. It can give you a very good sense of what the project is and how to find more information about contributing to it.

### Contributing
The Contributing file is your best friend when interacting with a project. This file sets out how the project prefers to receive contributions, and the requirements and parameters a contribution must meet to be accepted into the project. Be sure to review this doc before starting your work on the project. Follow any guidelines it gives regarding how to best open an issue, claim and issue to work on, submit a pull request, or get help. 

### Code of Conduct
The Code of Conduct (CoC) is a document that is appearing in more and more projects every year. It is used set the behavior guidelines that document what is both welcome and unwelcome in that project community, the consequences for unwelcome behavior, and where and how community members can report it. The intention of the CoC is to encourage behavior that creates a welcoming and safe place for all contributors. The existence of a Code of Conduct is a sign that a project values the safety of its community and is willing to back that up with action. Sometimes you'll find this information laid out in the Contributing file.

### License
The License file declares the terms under which folks are permitted to use, modify, and distribute the project.
It’s only through that license that a project can be “open source,” and only through that license that the project can legally be used, modified, and distributed. Occasionally, I've found that maintainers will include licensing info in the Readme file instead of a separate License file.

If you come across an interesting project that has no mention of a license STOP and do not proceed. A project that is posted on GitHub isn't automatically open source. It must have a declared open source license somewhere on the project. It's a great idea to familiarize yourself with popular licenses and I'd recommend being cautious of a license that isn’t OSI-approved.

Those were the files you’re most likely to encounter when browsing open source projects, but a few more are relatively popular, particularly in older or very well-established projects.

## Others
The Security file is gaining in popularity since it's implementation on GitHub. This file gives instructions for reporting any security vulnerabilities in a project. You should also expect it to outline how the team would handle how any security bugs are handled and how those are disclosed to the community.

A Changelog is another file you may see. It contains a human-readable summary of all of the releases for the software and the changes that comprise each. The Changelog file can be very handy if you’re trying to determine whether the version of the software you’re using includes a certain bug fix. It’s also helpful for new contributors to see the development trajectory of the project.

Depending on the project, you may also find a styleguide for programming, for writing, for graphic design... It all depends upon the needs and preferences of the project. Sometimes these guides are included directly in the Contributing file, other times they are standalone documents. Whichever way they’re implemented, you must always read and follow these guidelines if they exist.
